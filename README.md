## Task
One of the more complex tasks in Ray is creation/management of placement groups. The
existing documentation is here:

https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/placement-group.html

Please rewrite this document in a way that is more accessible. Are there any things you would
suggest we change about the Ray Placement Group API to make it easier for people to use?
Do you have any other thoughts or suggestions?
